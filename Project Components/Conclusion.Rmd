An analysis of variance was conducted to compare HSB2 science performances for three socioeconomic groups. The data set was found to satisfy the criteria for conducting a valid ANOVA as the groups were independent, the units within groups were independent, the data is normally distributed, and the distribution is not skewed. Using the ANOVA, we can say with a 95% level of confidence that there is not a statistically significant difference between two or more of the groups. T tests were then used to compare the mean science scores for each SES level. These tests found high SES students obtained higher scores than middle or low SES students. The results also found that middle SES students obtained higher scores than low SES students.

Using bootstrapping, a 95% confidence interval for the true population mean science score was found to be `r round(boot_int[1],2)` < $mu$ < `r round(boot_int[2],2)`. A Tukey pairwise estimate was not conducted because
